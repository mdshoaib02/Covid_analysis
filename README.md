As a passionate data analyst, I’ve delved into the intricate world of pandemic data, exploring, visualizing, and deriving insights from the numbers that shape our lives. In this repository, you’ll find a collection of my work, from raw data extraction to polished Tableau dashboards.

## Data Exploration
### MySQL
In the depths of MySQL, I wielded SQL queries like a sorcerer. I summoned data from various sources—official health organizations, research papers, and even Twitter threads. I cleaned, transformed, and massaged the data until it whispered its secrets.

## Tableau Dashboards
Visual
Behold, my Tableau masterpieces! Each dashboard is a symphony of colors, charts, and filters. 
I’ve orchestrated visualizations that dance to the rhythm of infection rates, mortality curves, and recovery trends. Explore them, and let the data serenade your senses.

## Acknowledgments
I tip my wizard hat to the global health heroes, the unsung data wranglers, and the countless GitHub stars who’ve illuminated my path. May our data-driven quests continue, and may our dashboards shine brighter than a thousand suns.
